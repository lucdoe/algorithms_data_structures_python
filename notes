# Personal Notes for: "Manning | Grokking Algorithms by Aditya Y. Bhargava, Book, Learning Ressource"

Logarithms:
- Question: log10(100) == "How many 10s do I need to multiply to 100?"
- Answer: 2 (10x10)
- Flip of exponentials (10²)

Binary search: 
- algorithm
- only sorted arrays
- eliminating half the numbers, each step 
- should return index of n otherwise Null
- log time = log2(n)

Simle Search(Stupid Search):
- algorithm
- log time: n steps (e.g. 100 items, could take 100 steps to get item)
